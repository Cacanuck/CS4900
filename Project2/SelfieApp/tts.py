# This code patch was used to create the TTS files. It has been commented out as it is no longer needed for operation.

# from gtts import gTTS
# import pygame

# myText = 'Move Head Up'
# language = 'en'
# myobj = gTTS(text=myText, lang=language, slow=False)
# myobj.save("moveHeadUp.mp3")
# pygame.mixer.int()
# pygame.mixer.music.load("moveHeadUp.mp3")
# pygame.mixer.music.play()
